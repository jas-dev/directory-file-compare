# My collection of python automation modules

This is the begining of my python modules collection for common daily tasks. In the past, I've developed similar collections at work but since I keep work and personal well separated I haven't maintained a personal collection- Until now!

## File hashing, directory comparison, and file operations 

### The problem
I work with sizeable data sets, both personally and professionally. I value staying organized, and I have an effective data management system. But, my directories trees are filled with categorized files of different data clasifications, and working with them is too time consuming without using automation.

-I need to compare and modify directories often 
-I need to pivot on single or multiple artifacts often as part of research & analysis that requires enrichment
-I dislike repeating myself (DRY principle) and wasting time
-I need to programatically interact with various platforms and services
-I often need to do all the above as part of a larger application

### The solution
Here I have my intial collection, just a few functions I can import or call from cli as needed. I'll keep adding as I go. 

To do:

-API requests/interactions
-Bootstrapping various processes
-Analysis and reporting
-Other data cleaning and transformation
-OS automations
-Networking tools
